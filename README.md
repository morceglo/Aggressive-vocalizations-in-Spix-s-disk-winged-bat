## General info
We studied the intra and inter-group interactions that ensue as Spix’s disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) attempt to access limited roosting resources. Our results show that groups emit aggressive vocalizations while in the presence of intruders from other groups, but not during intragroup interactions. We also found that bats emitted more calls when interacting with nearby intruders, providing support for the nasty-neighbor hypothesis.
